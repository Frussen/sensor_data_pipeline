# Structured Streaming of Sensor Data
This project consist in the creation of a Data Pipeline that collects data from Arduino sensors and sends them to a cloud-based storage system, where a Spark cluster can be used for real-time data processing and analysis. List of tools used:

### Arduino
Arduino is an open-source electronics platform that consists of both hardware and software components, designed for creating interactive and programmable electronic projects.


### Spark
Apache Spark is an open-source unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. It provides an interface for programming clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance.


### Databricks
Databricks is a comprehensive, cloud-based (AWS) data analytics and machine learning platform that offers the scalability and automation needed to handle complex data workflows.
Databricks provides a collaborative workspace where data engineers, data scientists, and analysts can work together to explore data, build data pipelines, develop machine learning models, and gain insights from their data.


### AWS
Cloud computing platform that provides a wide range of scalable and flexible cloud services and infrastructure.


### Kafka
Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform that allows real-time data ingestion, processing, and distribution across applications and systems.
